I'll create a visual diagram of your job application automation workflow.

    subgraph "Application Preparation Detail"
        F1[Review Filtered Jobs] --> F2[Select Promising Positions]
        F2 --> F3[Run Document Customization]

Here's a visualization of your job application automation workflow. The diagram shows:

1. The four main components of your workflow:
   - Initial one-time setup tasks
   - Weekly process for job hunting
   - Monthly analysis and optimization
   - Error handling procedures

2. The flow between different stages, including:
   - How your weekly cycle operates (Monday to Wednesday with ongoing follow-ups)
   - How monthly analysis feeds back into improving your process
   - How the initial setup leads into your regular workflow

3. Expanded details for key elements:
   - Document preparation components
   - Application preparation steps

This visual representation should help you better understand the relationships between different parts of your workflow and identify the critical paths in your automation system.

Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any particular section of the diagram or if you need additional visualizations for specific aspects of the workflow.
