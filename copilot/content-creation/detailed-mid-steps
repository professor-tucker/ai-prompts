Step 1: Setting Up a Free Hugging Face API & Model

Hugging Face offers free AI models for text generation, summarization, and more. You can integrate one into your workflow without paying.

1.1 Create a Hugging Face Account

Go to Hugging Face

Sign up for a free account.


1.2 Get a Free API Token

Once logged in, visit Your API Tokens Page

Click "New Token"

Name it (e.g., "YouTubeBot")

Select "Read" access


Copy and save this token (youâ€™ll need it later).


1.3 Choose a Free Model

Browse Hugging Face Models

Select a model based on your needs:

Text Generation (e.g., Video Scripts) â†’ facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill

Summarization (e.g., Video Descriptions) â†’ sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6

Speech-to-Text (for Transcriptions) â†’ facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h



1.4 Access Model via API

Install Python if you havenâ€™t already:

pkg install python

Install the Hugging Face transformers and requests libraries:

pip install transformers requests

Create a script to interact with the API:

import requests

API_TOKEN = "your_huggingface_api_token"
MODEL = "facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill"  # Change this based on your needs
API_URL = f"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/{MODEL}"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}

def query(payload):
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=HEADERS, json=payload)
    return response.json()

user_input = "Create a YouTube video script about AI automation."
response = query({"inputs": user_input})

print(response)


How This Works

This script sends a prompt to the Hugging Face model.

It returns AI-generated text.

You can modify the prompt to generate scripts, video descriptions, or more.

Step 2: Automating with Zapier

Zapier connects different tools to automate workflows. Youâ€™ll use it to automate Hugging Face outputs and post content to YouTube.

2.1 Create a Free Zapier Account

Go to Zapier Signup

Create an account.


2.2 Set Up a Zap to Automate Video Scripts

Click "Create a Zap"

Select Trigger â†’ Choose "Schedule by Zapier"

Set it to run daily or weekly to generate video scripts automatically.


Action 1: Choose "Webhooks by Zapier"

Select POST Request

URL: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer your_huggingface_api_token
Content-Type: application/json

Body:

{
  "inputs": "Generate a YouTube script about AI automation."
}


Action 2: Send the script to Google Docs for editing

Select "Google Docs" â†’ "Create Document"

Use {{response}} from the Webhook as the content.


Action 3 (Optional): Auto-upload the final script to YouTube Studio

Select "YouTube" â†’ "Upload Video"

Add Title, Description, and Tags dynamically.



How This Works

Zapier schedules the Hugging Face API call.

The AI generates a YouTube script and saves it to Google Docs.

Optionally, it uploads content to YouTube.
